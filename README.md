# 3DCity
Android app, takes sets of connected 3D points and draws them on your screen. Player moves by touching their screen, and looks around by rotating their phone.

###Movement

Look around by turning your phone. Hold edges of phone to move right, left, forward, backward. Tap center to jump.

###Creation

Made from scratch over mostly one weekend. Used linear algebra concepts to find points relative to view, project them onto screen, and morph them to avoid odd behavior.
